# Python-For-Cybersecurity
This repository tracks my 12-week journey of learning Python with a focus on cybersecurity applications, including red team automation, blue team detection, log parsing, networking, and more.
## 📆 Weekly Structure

Each folder represents one week of focused learning and includes scripts, notes, and challenges related to:

- Core Python syntax and scripting
- File parsing and system automation
- Networking tools and port scanners
- API-based threat intel queries
- Red team tools (keyloggers, bruteforce)
- Blue team scripts (log detection, hashing)
- Final project: detection engine or toolkit

## 🧠 Goals

- Automate security workflows
- Build both offensive and defensive tools
- Prepare for red teaming, SOC analyst, or cloud security roles

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- `os`, `sys`, `re`, `argparse`
- `socket`, `requests`, `hashlib`, `subprocess`
- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `schedule`

## 🏁 Final Project (Week 12)

Choose a red or blue team toolset and build a capstone script or toolkit.
